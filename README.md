#PASON
Process Automation Serial Object Network

The Cognitive Context Aware Industrial Protocol.

PASON is an open source project that aims to provide a decentralised infrastructure for Machine to Machine communication where context is imbued at the communications layer.

PASON enables any two machines, ranging from microcontrollers, edge, fog, or cloud to scaleably and performantly request or communicate machine state, and additional needed context to understand a-priori the state of any complex system or process.

Pason was built as a modern framework for use in systems that are physically connected, have sensors, and need to communicate sthe state of that complex system performantly with low overhead and maximal context.

Pason being a modern protocol uses modern transports. Therefore it uses the following dependencies.
